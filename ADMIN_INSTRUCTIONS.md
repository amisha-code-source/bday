# üîê Admin Instructions

## Admin Access

### Default Login Credentials
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Changing the Admin Password
To change the admin password, edit the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable in `script.js`:

```javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'your_new_password_here';
```

## Admin Features

### 1. Login System
- Enter the admin password to access the admin panel
- Session persists until logout or browser is closed
- Invalid password attempts show error messages

### 2. Admin Dashboard
- **Statistics Display**: Shows total wishes, unique authors, and total likes
- **Wish Management**: View all submitted wishes in a beautiful card layout
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics and wishes update automatically

### 3. Data Management
- **Export Data**: Download all wishes as a JSON file
- **Clear All**: Remove all wishes with confirmation prompt
- **Refresh**: Reload data and statistics
- **Individual Delete**: Delete specific wishes by hovering and clicking trash icon

### 4. User Experience
- **Public View**: Regular users can only submit wishes
- **Admin View**: Only admins can see submitted wishes
- **Form Validation**: Ensures data quality before submission
- **Success/Error Messages**: Clear feedback for all actions

## Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- Password is stored in plain text in JavaScript (client-side)
- Session is managed via localStorage
- **This is suitable for demonstration purposes only**

### For Production Use
Consider implementing:
- Server-side authentication
- Encrypted password storage
- Session tokens
- HTTPS encryption
- Database backend (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Can't login**: Check if password is correct (default: `admin123`)
2. **Wishes not showing**: Ensure you're logged in as admin
3. **Data not persisting**: Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
4. **Export not working**: Ensure browser allows file downloads

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
